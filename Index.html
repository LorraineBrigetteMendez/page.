    <p>
        In case you didn’t know, Mars is in retrograde from December 2024 until February 2025—and it's known to be the "most intense" astrological period of the year.
        
        "This event promises to be particularly intense due to a challenging aspect with Pluto in early January,” Resti Santiago a.k.a. The Filipino Astrologer explained to PhilSTAR L!fe. "Pluto is associated with deep transformation and power struggles, which, when combined with Mars' retrograde energy, can lead to heightened emotions, conflicts, and impulsive behavior.”
        
        "Mars will also be in the sign of its weakness in Cancer, making it more negative in its expression,” he added.
        
        According to the astrologer, those with ascendant, sun, or moon in Leo as well as Cancer could “feel this retrograde most acutely” this December and January-February next year, respectively. Those who have Aries and Scorpio ascendants could also get significantly affected by the astrological transit.

       <h2>How to navigate this period</h2> 
       <p> In order to make it through the astrological movement that will run until Feb. 24, Santiago advised Aries and Scorpio ascendants to put their physical health first through regular exercise and sufficient sleep.
        
        For all signs, he said it's important to refrain from initiating significant endeavors, "such as legal battles, major purchases like cars or machinery, or hiring of new employees."
        
        Avoiding extreme emotions and sudden decisions could also help.
        
        "Be cautious of impulsive reactions and avoid excessive criticism, both self-directed and outward," Santiago stressed, adding that this can be done by practicing mindfulness and emotional intelligence.
        
        Lastly, cultivate patience. "Strive to understand different perspectives and approach situations with empathy and compassion," he continued.</p>
